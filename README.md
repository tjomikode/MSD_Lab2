# Mobile Systems Development #2 Laboratory work
1. Was having issues with pushing my project to Github repository since it was impossible to do it from xCode so I did it via console.
2. Was having some issues with working xCode playground, I had to reload xCode lots of times as it was freezed trying to execute my program and didn't show any outputs(I use macOS emulator).
3. Was having issues with sum of two times, but I have successfully surfed through Google and found some clues to solve it.
